These files are useful in creating a MySQL database from the SR22 nutrition
information produced by the USDA.

You must first create a new user and database, make sure that these are
referred to in createdb.sh.

Then make sure you have a recent copy of mdb-tools.  These tools are used to
convert the sr22 data from access format into SQL.

Edit create_db.sh to reflect your local MySQL installation, user, password, and
database.

Then:

    make sr22

This should insert all the data into your mysql database!
